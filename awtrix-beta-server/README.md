**This is a beta release of the addon, use at your own risk**

There is no arrangment with blueforcer, so i build this by try and error. It works on my HA and it should work on many other HA. But no guarranty. Be carefull.

# Warning
!!backup all your configs (premiumkey). uninstall the old version!!

## Usage

Access the server via ingress, so no port config is necesarry

The config and the apps folder are accesible as /config/awtrix/apps and /config/awtrix/config. So no ftp is needed

|option|default|usage|
|---|---|---|
|version|`beta`| select the awtrix host to run beta => https://blueforcer.de/awtrix/beta/awtrix.jar or stable => https://blueforcer.de/awtrix/stable/awtrix.jar
|lang|`en_EN`| the language used e.g. for the DayOfTheWeeK App set "de_DE" for german|

To go from stable to beta and vice versa you have to rebuild the addon!

See [awtrix homepage](https://docs.blueforcer.de/#/v2/README) for more details
