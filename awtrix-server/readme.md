**This is a beta release of the addon**

- On build/rebuild the actual server version is downloaded
- To restart the server don't use the restart button on the awtrix server use restart from the addon.

Access the server with the ip from your hass.io system with port 7000!
So usually http://hassio.local:7000
When you compile your controller you should also use the ip from your hass.io server!!

See [awtrix homepage](https://docs.blueforcer.de/#/v2/README) for more details
